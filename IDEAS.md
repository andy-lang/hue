To-Do for this Doc
----------------------------
1. Sort things in a logical manner
2. Edit layout

Ideas
--------------------------

1. Make the transitions between levels more obvious
2. Vague/basic instructions
3. Quotes between levels. Buddhist philosophy,  colour theory (inc. psychology),  tell a story
4. Story elements,  what's Hugh's motivation
5. Change Hugh's colour based on level success/progression
6. Different colours have different effects.  speed+/-,  proximity based size,  change radius of Hugh's view,  positive and negative effects,  extended FOV memory,  
7. Objects fade from view based on time since they were in Hugh's FOV,  maybe the walls remain visible for longer
8. Change Hugh's shape or size (maybe via other colours),  fit through gaps,  pass through odd shapes,  increase size to touch multiple goals at once
9. Hugh has no pronoun,  refer to hugh as you etc
10. [potential source of quotes](https://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodreads.com%2Fwork%2Fquotes%2F100074&h=OAQHhrlMI&s=1)
11. Change effect of colours based on player interaction (challenge the players prejudices re: colours)
12. Break levels into sets based on colours,  maybe also to introduce game mechanics
13. Colours with "enemies",  based off contrasting colours or colour theory,  eg: Red vs Blue
14. "the shortest path between two points is not always a straight line"
15. Wormholes and non Euclidean space for reasons
16.  Blue could trigger events (eg: opening doors, unblocking areas),  visual clues give feedback to the player,  eg: the trigger appears semi-faded as if it was recently in your FOV
17. Visual map editor ingame
18. options,  eg sound volume
19. Screen edges bleed colour into "Fog of war" area based on game context,  eg: if we're surrounded by "enemy" colours the screen starts to fade toward that colour
